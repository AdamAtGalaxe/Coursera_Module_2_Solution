                    <p>Sushi consumption can lead to anisakiasis. It's caused by eating fish infected with a parasitic worm which attaches to your 
                        esophagus, stomach, or intestines and can cause food poisoning. The best way to prevent the disease is to completely 
                        avoid eating raw or undercooked fish or squid.</p>
